                          BIANCHI PACKAGE
  Simulating Bianchi induced temperature fluctuations in CMB maps
  ---------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
     This package provides functionality to support the simulation of
     Bianchi Type VIIh induced temperature fluctuations in CMB maps
     of a universe with shear and rotation.  The implementation is
     based on the solutions to the Bianchi models derived by 
     Barrow et al. (1985), which do not incorporate any dark 
     energy component.  Functionality is provided to compute the
     induced fluctuations on the sphere directly in either real or
     harmonic space.

REFERENCE
     The BIANCHI package was written originally to determine whether
     recent evidence for non-Gaussianity in WMAP CMB observations were
     due to Bianchi contributions.  The code is based on solutions to
     the Bianchi models derived by:
       Barrow J. D., Juszkiewica R., Sonoda D. H., 1985, MNRAS, 213, 917
     If you use the code to produce published works please reference
